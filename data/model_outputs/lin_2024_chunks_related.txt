""Linde received for the products it manufactures. Examples of products not included are those manufactured  by Linde Advanced Material Technologies (LAMT) and low-volume products, such as acetylene. Using air as its raw material, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen, argon and rare gases through several air separation processes, of which cryogenic air  separation is the most prevalent. As air is a renewable natural resource, there is no negative environmental consequence to using this raw material.""
""Process gases, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, specialty gases and acetylene, are produced by methods other than  air separation. In many cases, these are sourced as an industrial byproduct or waste. Some of these byproduct sources are renewable, but all offer a  means to reuse products that would otherwise have been waste. The volumes of process gases procured are considered business confidential. •    Most carbon dioxide is purchased from byproduct sources,""
""including chemical plants, refineries and industrial processes. These byproduct sources  include ethanol  fermentation facilities, where the waste carbon dioxide is considered biogenic. A portion is recovered from carbon dioxide wells. •  The majority of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are produced by either reforming of natural gas or by purifying byproduct sources obtained from  the chemical and petrochemical industries. In 2024, Linde procured 18 percent byproduct hydrogen.  •      Helium is""
""acquired from several sources, including helium-rich natural gas streams. •   Acetylene can be produced from calcium carbide and water. A significant percentage is purchased as a chemical byproduct. Recycled input materials used  301-2 Also see the disclosure for GRI 301-1 for information on renewable raw materials. As part of its sustainable supply chain program, Linde’s Procurement  organization works with vendors to reduce consumption of upstream, non-renewable natural resources. For some of""
""its business lines, Linde actively  sources recycled input materials by using byproducts from other industrial processes. The total weight of these byproducts as a percentage of total  material use is not reported here. Since 2011, most of the acetylene produced by Linde in the U.S. was sourced from byproduct acetylene, avoiding the mining of calcium carbonate and  the recycling or disposal of carbide lime. Some of the Linde carbon dioxide sold in the U.S. is sourced from ethanol fermentation (a""
""biomass source). As  a business, Linde is constantly researching innovative ways to expand the use of this application. Most gases are transported in pipelines or trucks and use little packaging. Cylinder products are typically transported by truck.  (See the disclosure for GRI 301-3.) Linde has a global engineering business, which designs and constructs new production plants. When building a new plant, the focus is on the re-use  of parts/components from other dissembled plants (e.g.,""
""refurbished parts) as much as possible. At the end-of-life of a production facility, parts and  components are checked, refurbished if required, and directly re-used or put in stock for future usage. Thus, most of the materials are recycled and  become input materials (e.g., for new plants). To avoid procuring new materials, the company has established several asset management programs that are actively identifying idle assets (e.g.,  cylinders) to ensure that they are put back into use rather""
""than purchasing new materials. The programs actively track all assets, are well reported and  yield good results.  Reclaimed products and their packaging materials  301-3 Linde produces very little packaging waste. Linde delivers most of its product in pipelines or bulk trucks, or in cylinders. As the products are  consumable, there is nothing to reclaim and no packaging material for the majority of products. The majority of cylinders used in the packaged gases  product lines are reusable. The""
""metal cylinders last about 40 years, are returnable and are typically reused multiple times. Where disposable cylinders  are used, recycling methods are recommended to customers.  Linde runs several large cylinder refurbishment centers worldwide as well as many smaller test shops and repair centers in many countries. In its  cylinder test shop in Wolverhampton, U.K., Linde typically has refurbished about 350,000 cylinders annually to avoid unnecessary scrapping.  301-1  Linde 2024 Sustainable""

Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions  305-1 Linde’s total Scope 1 emissions in 2024 totaled 16.5 million metric tons CO₂e, which is a decrease of 1 percent from 2023. This is mainly attributed to  decreases in""
""production volumes and efficiency improvements. The primary source of Scope 1 emissions for Linde is the combustion of natural gas at  hydrogen plants, which represented 12.2 million metric tons of Scope 1 emissions in 2024. Another portion is from ASU plants using natural gas for  energy generation, which amounted to 2.3 million metric tons CO₂e. Smaller sources of Scope 1 emissions are other GHGs (e.g., from methane plants or  nitrous oxide plants) or other types of GHG emissions that are""

Calculation Methodology""
""Hydrogen plants, which represent the largest source of Linde’s Scope 1 emissions, consume natural gas, both for fuel and feedstock. To determine  Scope 1 emissions, the amount of carbon produced as product is subtracted from the carbon content of the fuel and feedstock. In addition, Linde  calculates Scope 1 emissions from gas losses (during production and filling processes). These are calculated for nitrous oxide manufacturing and  filling facilities, carbon dioxide plants, on-site""
""refrigeration equipment and cylinder filling operations associated with CH₄, SF₆, PFCs, HFCs and NF₃.   HyCO plants/facilities that are owned by Linde are fully reported under Scope 1, regardless of whether they are leased out or independent on who is  running the plant or providing the fuel or feedstock.  Linde 2024 Sustainable Development Report 59 To calculate Scope 1 emissions from natural gas, Linde uses the reported natural gas factors from each production plant (depending on the mix  of""
""hydrocarbons). If a specific natural gas factor is not available or known, Linde uses a chemical natural gas to CO₂ conversion factor from the  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), from the Government of United Kingdom. For other fuels, Linde uses DEFRA factors to  convert to CO₂ equivalents. Emissions from transport are calculated based on actual kilometers driven for commercial and non-commercial vehicles, multiplied by average  emission factors by vehicle type from the""

Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions  305-2 Linde’s Scope 2 GHG emissions in 2024 totaled 20.9 million metric tons CO₂e (market-based), which is a 3 percent decrease from 2023. The largest  electricity users are ASUs, which account for approximately""
""90 percent of all electricity used. These emissions were calculated using the market-based approach. Linde utilizes market-based emissions factors where possible. In some cases,  market-based factors may be higher than location-based factors and may result in increases in Scope 2 emissions. Compared to 2023, Scope 2  emissions have decreased, due to in changes in production, as well as increased sourcing of renewable energy and efficiency improvements. Linde also calculated Scope 2 emissions for""
