""OFFICER  NISOURCE INC. At NiSource, we are focused on our strategic priorities to achieve a clear  and defined goal of driving value and enabling growth in an evolving energy  ecosystem that benefits our customers, employees, communities, and  business partners. These priorities include delivering net-zero greenhouse  gas emissions by 2040, diversifying our energy options by including low- carbon fuels and renewable energy sources, evolving our gas and electric  systems operations, and""
""structuring our offerings to ensure NiSource  services are affordable, accessible, and an excellent value for our  customers.    Maintaining our steady approach to reach these priorities requires a  corporate strategy intrinsically tied to our environmental, social, and  governance (ESG) objectives.

""over the past year in the  sustainable energy transition, planning for a diverse supply of energy options  for generations to come. As part of this effort, we launched a multiphase  hydrogen blending project in a controlled setting, mixing hydrogen and  natural gas at precise levels to determine optimal blend percentages and  assess their environmental and consumer benefits. Natural gas remains  a priority for NiSource as we continue to recognize its value while using  innovative ways to deliver""

In the near term, we will be investing an additional $1.7 billion between  2024 and 2028 to transition away from coal generation and support transmission development  for new renewable generation sources. We will also be investing $8.5 billion to continue the  modernization of our gas distribution system, including the ability to""
""deliver low- and zero-carbon  fuel sources. Delivering our net-zero goal is a strategic priority for NiSource that is supported by  several objectives, key performance indicators, and workstreams. By the end of 2023, we had reduced Scope 1 GHG emissions by approximately 72% from 2005  levels. Through deliberate investment to reduce emissions by retiring coal generation facilities,  transitioning to renewable energy, and reducing methane emissions from gas distribution  operations, NiSource is on""
""track to achieve a 90% reduction in Scope 1 emissions by 2030 from  2005 levels. Significantly, NiSource was the only utility parent company to earn an “A” grade in the  Sierra Club’s 2023 report on the clean energy transition. We plan to achieve net zero primarily through the continuation and enhancement of existing  programs, such as retiring and replacing coal-fired electric generation with low- or zero-emission  electric generation, ongoing pipe replacement and modernization programs, and""
""deploying  advanced leak-detection equipment. We also plan to leverage other low- or zero-emission energy  resources and technologies. These may include hydrogen, renewable natural gas, long-duration  storage, and/or carbon capture and utilization technologies, when they become technically and  economically feasible. Carbon offsets and renewable energy credits (RECs) may ultimately be  used as part of our net-zero efforts, including, for example, acquiring RECs to reduce Scope 2  emissions. To""
""date, we have not purchased RECs or offsets to meet our net-zero goal. NIPSCO  has in the past sold, and in the future may sell, the RECs from our electric generation facilities to a  third party because this helps lower energy costs for our customers. Decarbonizing the use of natural gas will require a coordinated and collaborative stakeholder  approach. To this end, NiSource conducted scenario analysis through 2050 that includes 1.5-2°C  scenarios based on the International Energy""
""Association’s Sustainable Development Scenario.  In these scenarios, decarbonization is driven by both policy and market forces, and scenarios  provide “bookends” of possible future states for NiSource and our customers. The result of the  analysis was that policy-driven (or forced) decarbonization causes the highest cost to customers.  A lower cost to the customer scenario was achieved in a coordinated state, in which economywide  coordination and cooperation between stakeholders leads to more""
""efficient outcomes with lower  technology costs and faster adoption rates. This coordinated state includes a mix of energy  efficiency, renewable natural gas and hydrogen fuel blending, and balanced electrification.

The 2021 IRP builds upon the 2018 IRP, which outlined   16 NIPSCO’s plan to retire our coal-generating assets by 2028.

This multiphase project allows the controlled  blending of hydrogen with natural gas at a rate ranging up to 20% hydrogen. This project also  allows us to conduct trials on piping, appliances, and materials that replicate field scenarios. It also  will help our employees understand the impact of using hydrogen in the existing""
""infrastructure from  safety, customer experience, and employee standpoints. The results of these field trials, which  continued in 2024, will assist our companies in determining hydrogen’s role in our decarbonization  program. Our initial data and results—along with those produced across the industry—predict  promise for hydrogen in our energy future. The federal government also has a role in advancing hydrogen. The U.S. Department of Energy  has selected two hydrogen hubs in our territories as""
""recipients of funding designated in the  18 A Picarro-Equipped Vehicle Hydrogen Blending Skid in Monaca, PA Hydrogen Tiny Home  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support the development of regional clean hydrogen  hubs.

""Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Work is underway to determine what role  NiSource companies may have in these hubs.  RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OPPORTUNITIES  Increasing the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) is also a key component of our strategic  priority to expand sustainable fuels. RNG is interchangeable with conventional natural gas and  provides many of the same safe and reliable usage benefits to customers while lowering the  greenhouse gas impact. Looking at the life cycle of RNG, it""
""is a byproduct of the decomposition of organic matter from  sources such as landfills, livestock operations, and wastewater treatment facilities. Because it  comes from organic sources that once absorbed carbon dioxide, RNG can be carbon neutral. As  an additional benefit, it is produced from organic waste that would otherwise decay and release  methane into the atmosphere.  Since RNG is interchangeable with natural gas, no additional updates are needed to our existing  natural gas distribution""
""infrastructure. RNG is available now, and the supply is growing every  year. By continuing to expand our energy mix and customer offerings, NiSource believes we can  continue to meet the sustainable energy needs of our customers for decades to come.  Today, all our operating companies offer RNG producers the opportunity to interconnect with our  gas distribution systems, through which our companies can transport RNG to the market. Each  company has high quality standards set in place""
""specifically for the RNG that enters our systems.  To streamline the process, each NiSource company allows RNG producers to submit applications  through the company website.  NiSource is also advocating for favorable and supportive policies that enable investments in  additional sustainable fuel sources. At the state level, we engage with chambers of commerce,  business roundtables, farm bureaus, and restaurant associations to advance legislation that  enables the development of renewable energy""
""and low- or no-carbon fuels.  For example, in June 2022, Columbia Gas of Virginia (CVA) advocated for the Virginia Energy  Innovation Act, which allows for the robust development of renewable natural gas in the  commonwealth of Virginia.

This phase of the remediation included removal of subsurface structures  remaining from the former gas manufacturing operations and in-situ soil  stabilization (ISS) of 15,000 cubic yards of impacted soil. ISS involves mixing  the affected soil with a blend of reagents to encapsulate the original material  and""
""contaminants, as opposed to standard excavation, which requires hauling  material off-site to a landfill. ISS enables the material to be stabilized in place  and remain on-site, all while binding potential contamination to prevent its  migration into the environment.
