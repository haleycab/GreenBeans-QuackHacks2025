"OFFICER  NISOURCE INC. At NiSource, we are focused on our strategic priorities to achieve a clear  and defined goal of driving value and enabling growth in an evolving energy  ecosystem that benefits our customers, employees, communities, and  business partners. These priorities include delivering net-zero greenhouse  gas emissions by 2040, diversifying our energy options by including low- carbon fuels and renewable energy sources, evolving our gas and electric  systems operations, and"
"structuring our offerings to ensure NiSource  services are affordable, accessible, and an excellent value for our  customers.    Maintaining our steady approach to reach these priorities requires a  corporate strategy intrinsically tied to our environmental, social, and  governance (ESG) objectives. We are on track to retire our coal operations  by 2028, and we have made progress in advancing strategies to expand our  sustainable fuels business.    NiSource has also made considerable progress"
"over the past year in the  sustainable energy transition, planning for a diverse supply of energy options  for generations to come. As part of this effort, we launched a multiphase  hydrogen blending project in a controlled setting, mixing hydrogen and  natural gas at precise levels to determine optimal blend percentages and  assess their environmental and consumer benefits. Natural gas remains  a priority for NiSource as we continue to recognize its value while using  innovative ways to deliver"
"it to our customers with reduced emissions.  By the close of 2023, our investors had invested nearly $19 billion in rate  base across NiSource and our Northern Indiana Public Service Company  LLC (NIPSCO) and Columbia Gas subsidiaries. Investing in our communities  is our business model, with approximately $16 billion of planned investments  between 2024 and 2028—including $2.5 billion to support our energy  generation transition and $8.5 billion to further modernize our distribution  pipeline"
"infrastructure. Doing this while keeping costs low for our customers,  being a good steward of the environment, and operating with a sound  safety record allows us to work collaboratively with regulators and other  stakeholders. This positively impacts our return on investment, lowers our  cost of capital, and better serves our customers.    ESG is also an important part of our business strategy.

These may include hydrogen, renewable natural gas, long-duration  storage, and/or carbon capture and utilization technologies, when they become technically and  economically feasible. Carbon offsets and renewable energy credits (RECs) may ultimately be  used as part of our net-zero efforts, including, for example, acquiring RECs to reduce Scope 2  emissions. To"
"date, we have not purchased RECs or offsets to meet our net-zero goal. NIPSCO  has in the past sold, and in the future may sell, the RECs from our electric generation facilities to a  third party because this helps lower energy costs for our customers. Decarbonizing the use of natural gas will require a coordinated and collaborative stakeholder  approach. To this end, NiSource conducted scenario analysis through 2050 that includes 1.5-2°C  scenarios based on the International Energy"
"Association’s Sustainable Development Scenario.  In these scenarios, decarbonization is driven by both policy and market forces, and scenarios  provide “bookends” of possible future states for NiSource and our customers.

A lower cost to the customer scenario was achieved in a coordinated state, in which economywide  coordination and cooperation between stakeholders leads to more"

RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OPPORTUNITIES  Increasing the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) is also a key component of our strategic  priority to expand sustainable fuels. RNG is interchangeable with conventional natural gas and  provides many of the same safe and reliable usage benefits to customers while lowering the  greenhouse gas impact. Looking at the life cycle of RNG, it"
"is a byproduct of the decomposition of organic matter from  sources such as landfills, livestock operations, and wastewater treatment facilities. Because it  comes from organic sources that once absorbed carbon dioxide, RNG can be carbon neutral. As  an additional benefit, it is produced from organic waste that would otherwise decay and release  methane into the atmosphere.  Since RNG is interchangeable with natural gas, no additional updates are needed to our existing  natural gas distribution"
"infrastructure. RNG is available now, and the supply is growing every  year. By continuing to expand our energy mix and customer offerings, NiSource believes we can  continue to meet the sustainable energy needs of our customers for decades to come.  Today, all our operating companies offer RNG producers the opportunity to interconnect with our  gas distribution systems, through which our companies can transport RNG to the market. Each  company has high quality standards set in place"
"specifically for the RNG that enters our systems.  To streamline the process, each NiSource company allows RNG producers to submit applications  through the company website.

"site, the Dean H.  Mitchell Generating Station, and the Petersburg MGP site.  NIPSCO FORMER MICHIGAN CITY MGP NIPSCO performed a soil remediation project at this site in 2022 and 2023.  This phase of the remediation included removal of subsurface structures  remaining from the former gas manufacturing operations and in-situ soil  stabilization (ISS) of 15,000 cubic yards of impacted soil. ISS involves mixing  the affected soil with a blend of reagents to encapsulate the original material  and"
"contaminants, as opposed to standard excavation, which requires hauling  material off-site to a landfill. ISS enables the material to be stabilized in place  and remain on-site, all while binding potential contamination to prevent its  migration into the environment. Because ISS avoids the shipment of impacted  soils off-site and filling of landfill space, the effort saved an estimated 88,682  miles of truck traffic to transport the 15,000 cubic yards (19,510 tons/887  truckloads) of impacted"
"soil. More importantly, in addition to landfill avoidance,  the avoidance of this significant truck traffic requirement significantly reduced  the carbon footprint associated with this effort. In addition, NIPSCO has  chosen to plant and seed the site with a pollinator habitat mix. The pollinator  habitat will provide approximately 1.5 acres of grasses and wildflowers,  furnishing cover, nectar, and pollen for native pollinators and avoiding the  maintenance associated with summer mowing."

"DEAN H. MITCHELL GENERATING STATION ISS and the planting of pollinator habitat was also implemented for the  remediation of NIPSCO’s former Mitchell Generating Station. The Mitchell  Generating Station was a 500 MW coal-fired electric generation plant in Gary,  Indiana, that operated from 1956 until its retirement in 2002. The generating  station and associated infrastructure were razed in 2018. NIPSCO addressed hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste and associated  environmental impacts at the"
"site under the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act (RCRA). Several solid waste management units (SWMUs) were  identified in our RCRA investigation. An SWMU is defined as a unit at which  solid wastes have been placed at any time, irrespective of whether the unit  was intended for the management of solid or hazardous waste.  The SWMUs in this case included six former ash ponds utilized during the  electric operations, five of which were remediated between August 2016 and  February 2017."
"Remedial action on the single remaining ash impoundment  began in 2023. The closure, initiated in 2023 with scheduled completion in  2024, utilized ISS.  By remediating the CCR in place, the closure reduced potential truck traffic by  more than 7,000 truckloads and reduced potential soil backfill requirements by  approximately 80,000 tons.  The final cover being installed over the ISS mixture includes a biodiverse  application through which NIPSCO will plant and seed the former ash  impoundment"
"with a pollinator habitat mix. The pollinator habitat will provide  about two acres of grass and wildflowers to offer cover, nectar, and pollen for  native pollinators and eliminate cover maintenance such as mowing or other  grass controls. COLUMBIA GAS OF VIRGINIA – PETERSBURG FORMER MGP SITE CVA uses the former MGP site in Petersburg, Virginia, at the corner of Bank  Street and Madison Street, as an operations center. The MGP was initially  constructed around 1850. Part of that pre-Civil War"
"structure remains and is  connected to an expansion constructed in 1880. The entire building is brick  and covers 4,500 square feet. The building has historical significance. A  former chimney on the pre-Civil War portion was used as a target by the Union  Army during the Siege of Petersburg, and the entire building is a rare example  of an industrial building of that period. Extensive investigation at the site indicated that MGP residuals, including  coal tar, are near and beneath the building."
"The remedial strategy developed  to address this material included demolition of the building, which was  considered the most efficient and lowest-cost approach for remediating  the coal tar. However, the Historical Petersburg Foundation and the local  community hope to preserve the building. In 2024, CVA has committed to  work toward remediation while preserving the building, an approach that, while  more complicated, is more consistent with the previously expressed desire of  the local"
"community. We will listen to and understand the community’s desires  and concerns and address them in our remediation plan.
